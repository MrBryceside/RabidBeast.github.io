The ability to create a portal beneath me that I fall through, and then another perpendicular portal opens up where ever I want, so I can use the momentum of falling to dropkick people, and then immediately teleport back to where I started. I think it would be really fun to do that to certain people (celebrities, politicians, etc) every couple of months to keep them on their toes.</p>
